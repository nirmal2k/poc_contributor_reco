0,"Minimizing civilian casualties during the siege of Mariupol? What are the best practices of minimizing civilian casualties in cities under siege, as applied to the siege of Mariupol?
I am looking for best practices from the perspective of world civilians, including civilians inside and outside of Mariupol. So please, no answers advocating WWIII to help Mariupol civilians.
Realistic scenarios only, please!

8,"Why not have a wealth dependent income tax? Usually states implement a progressive tax. So people with a higher income have to pay a higher tax rate. 

However I think that this is not helping much to distribute wealth more equally. Instead I imagine that it would be better to have an income tax which depends on someone's already existing wealth. So someone who has already accumulated a lot of wealth would have to pay a higher income tax compared to someone who doesn't own a lot. The rationale for this is that this would make it easier for someone with nothing (e.g. young people) to accumulate wealth quickly if she/he has a high income job. But the accumulation of wealth would automatically slow down if one already has enough. Wouldn't such a tax system be better for decreasing the wealth gap?

Why don't we have a wealth dependent income tax?

UPDATE: I toned down my wording a bit to make clear that I do not want communism or socialism. What I want is to decrease the wealth gap and distribute the wealth more equally. I do not want to eliminate all differences in wealth. But I believe the state should give an incentive for very wealthy people to retire and also make it easier for the young or unwealthy to become wealthy.

UPDATE2: To compute the income tax based on wealth I imagine a formula like this:

income_tax_percentage = ( 1 - (100000 $/(wealth_in_$))) * 100%.

However I think that this is not helping much to distribute wealth more equally. Instead I imagine that it would be better to have an income tax which depends on someone's already existing wealth. So someone who has already accumulated a lot of wealth would have to pay a higher income tax compared to someone who doesn't own a lot. The rationale for this is that this would make it easier for someone with nothing (e.g. young people) to accumulate wealth quickly if she/he has a high income job. But the accumulation of wealth would automatically slow down if one already has enough. Wouldn't such a tax system be better for decreasing the wealth gap?

Why don't we have a wealth dependent income tax?

UPDATE: I toned down my wording a bit to make clear that I do not want communism or socialism. What I want is to decrease the wealth gap and distribute the wealth more equally. I do not want to eliminate all differences in wealth. But I believe the state should give an incentive for very wealthy people to retire and also make it easier for the young or unwealthy to become wealthy.

12,"Is it possible to expand voting right by ordinary legislation provided that there is no explicit constitutional restriction? I have noticed that while many constitutions guarantee voting rights for its citizens, these provisions are often phrased in a way that does not preclude expanding such right to people beyond the explicitly stated demographic.
A common way of phrasing it would be: &quot;X has the right to vote...&quot; rather than &quot;ONLY X has the right to vote...&quot;
Here are some examples:
Swedish constitution, Chapter 3, Part 3, Art 4:

Every Swedish citizen who is currently domiciled within the Realm or who has ever been domiciled within the Realm, and who has reached the age of eighteen, is entitled to vote in an election to the Riksdag.

Estonian constitution, Article 57:

An Estonian citizen who has attained eighteen years of age has the
right to vote.

German constitution, Article 38, Clause 2:

Any person who has attained the age of eighteen shall be entitled to vote; any person who has attained the age of majority may be elected.

In these cases, the provisions seem to imply an inclusive attitude - rather than an exclusionary attitude - towards suffrage, so would it be constitutional for the respective countries to pass legislations that grant voting rights to people beyond what is explicitly mentioned? Such as:

Permanent residents

Estonian constitution, Article 57:

German constitution, Article 38, Clause 2:

Any person who has attained the age of eighteen shall be entitled to vote; any person who has attained the age of majority may be elected.

Why don't they simply call themselves ""Americans""? No other people does this. Is this divisive or does it help establish comfortable groups for different ethnicities to reside in?

21,"What is the biggest flaw with this Democratic Taxation system? Imagine a country where up to 50% of the tax dollars are allocated by the people instead of congress/government. Once a year, the citizens file a vote with their tax return, which allocates percentages to the programs which they feel are most important. Each citizen controls an equal portion of the taxes (an equal fraction with no difference based on income).

The requirements for establishing a program are as follows:


0.5% of the citizen population must provide their verifiable signature to support a proposed program.
Programs must comply with all laws. They can't do anything illegal.
Programs cannot support the election of a candidate for any office.
Programs must publish an itemized budget each year of where funding went.
Programs are limited to spending 5% of their budget on advertising or external communication.
If benefits are limited to a group (for example low income individuals) this must be stated up-front. No part of the criteria to receive benefits can be based on the perceived support for any program.
There is a 6 month period from public announcement of the program where a veto is allowed to be established. If the veto is able to get twice as many signatures as the proposed program, then the proposed program will be cancelled.


Assume the following systems are established and working properly under this model:


The country has a democratically elected leader and functional court/law system.
Each citizen has full free speech and there is a functional news media. This news media is actively engaged in reporting underfunded issues, programs that are improperly using funds, and expected allocation of funds based on pre-polling.
Each citizen's vote is verified properly to come from them.
Each citizen is able to vote securely and privately. Votes remain private.
All votes are counted properly. The system for counting the votes is properly verified at all stages.
Programs do not receive any information about who voted for them. There is no way for them to verify this information.


All citizens get control over an equal portion of taxes. In a nation with $2 billion in tax revenue and 1 million citizens, they'd each get to allocate $1000. They are allowed to split the vote between any number of programs with up to 0.1% precision.

As an example, someone might choose to put 50% on a program to cure cancer, 20% on a program that repairs a highway they use regularly, 7.5% on a space exploration program, and the remaining 22.5% on a project to end homelessness by providing affordable housing for people. In that case, 500 dollars of the tax revenue would go to the cancer program, 200 dollars to the highway repair program, 75 dollars to space exploration, and 225 dollars to the homelessness project.

Each year the projects would receive their budget based on the votes and the total taxes collected. Votes would be collected securely and projects would not be told who had voted for them.

Given the above system and assuming that the above systems established function correctly (as listed above), what are the biggest problems that would or could occur with this system? By biggest problems, I mean the worst possible mis-allocation of funds that could reasonable occur, which results in the most undesirable outcome for the citizens of this country.

Once a year, the citizens file a vote with their tax return, which allocates percentages to the programs which they feel are most important. Each citizen controls an equal portion of the taxes (an equal fraction with no difference based on income).

The requirements for establishing a program are as follows:


0.5% of the citizen population must provide their verifiable signature to support a proposed program.
Programs must comply with all laws. They can't do anything illegal.
Programs cannot support the election of a candidate for any office.
Programs must publish an itemized budget each year of where funding went.
Programs are limited to spending 5% of their budget on advertising or external communication.
If benefits are limited to a group (for example low income individuals) this must be stated up-front. No part of the criteria to receive benefits can be based on the perceived support for any program.
There is a 6 month period from public announcement of the program where a veto is allowed to be established. If the veto is able to get twice as many signatures as the proposed program, then the proposed program will be cancelled.

The country has a democratically elected leader and functional court/law system.

All votes are counted properly. The system for counting the votes is properly verified at all stages.
Programs do not receive any information about who voted for them. There is no way for them to verify this information.


All citizens get control over an equal portion of taxes. In a nation with $2 billion in tax revenue and 1 million citizens, they'd each get to allocate $1000. They are allowed to split the vote between any number of programs with up to 0.1% precision.

As an example, someone might choose to put 50% on a program to cure cancer, 20% on a program that repairs a highway they use regularly, 7.5% on a space exploration program, and the remaining 22.5% on a project to end homelessness by providing affordable housing for people. In that case, 500 dollars of the tax revenue would go to the cancer program, 200 dollars to the highway repair program, 75 dollars to space exploration, and 225 dollars to the homelessness project.

26,"How do Libertarians address the case of ""I sold my soul to the company store""? One of the main arguments that large corporations would not pose a threat in minimal-government libertarian state is that the corporation theoretically has no monopoly on force. 

In other words, ""A corporation can not force you to submit to its monopoly"".

However, this general theoretical statement (assuming it's true) fails to account for one specific scenario (somewhat closely mirroring the issue with ""you're free to emigrate from USA if you don't ilke it"" situation):


You are raised in an area controlled by vertically integrated corporation
You get indebted to that corporation by your basic survival needs.
The indebtedness - while ""voluntarily"" entered in by your parents giving birth and raising you there - can not feasibly be escaped, even if you yourself aren't in debt when reaching the age of consent: 


The wages offered by MegaCorp are too low to pay for the living - OR leaving.
They squeezed out all the competition from local area due to owning all the land or offering cheap services at cost so there are no other employers in the area.



So, while the corporation does not commit acts of aggression, you are essentially forced to work for them against your will, with the ONLY other feasible choice being to not pay your debt and get thrown in jail, or starve to death.

How do libertarians (classical liberals) address this case of ""I sold my soul to the company store""?



Notes:


I'll accept the answer based on any flavor of libertarianism (except left wing libertarians in the mold of Matt Zwolinski). 
Ideally the answer should cover the approaches by all main strains, unless the answer is invariant to all of them.
I'm NOT interested in the the non-answer of ""this flavor holds that such vertically integrated monopolist MegaCorp can not theoretically arise in a libertarian society"". For one thing, it's possible if a bunch of people LIKE the idea and choose to form a commune in a form of such corporation voluntarily (ala Kapitalist Kibbutz, or Google :)
The answer should preferably be sourced/referenced from libertarian scholarship.

30,"Why do politicians create more advertising badmouthing their opponents, rather than promoting themselves? I live in Iowa and have been inundated with a lot of political advertising everywhere (TV, mail, internet) as the 2020 US election approaches. It seems to me that most of the political advertising from all side mostly focus on characterizing opposing candidates as evil rather than pointing out positive attributes of the candidate the ad is promoting.

35,"Why are countries still introducing COVID-19 quarantines for travelers from affected regions, even though it's been proven they don't work? Various governments seem to be playing whack-a-mole with travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines in the recent COVID-19 epidemic. First Chinese residents were banned from numerous countries. Afterwards travel bans expanded to South Korea, Japan, Iran and most recently Italy. Yet despite all the travel restrictions, the virus managed to successfully spread out all across the globe.
So why continue with the practice of restricting foreign travel, especially when the virus has already been identified to be spreading at the local level? E.g. why doesn't the US remove travel restrictions on Chinese visitors, given that the virus has already been detected in numerous states?
Update from Mar 21: There are now 10 thousand official cases in the US, but travel restrictions are still in place for some reason.
Update from Sep 1: There are now 6 million+ cases, but people from China, Brazil and the Schengen are are still banned from the US

38,"Why has the US not been more assertive in confronting Russia in recent years? Over the past few years, Russia seems to have been slipping back towards an authoritarian system of government, with Putin seemingly cementing his control of the country more and more. Along with this, Russia appears to have become increasingly hostile towards the West and emboldened/aggressive internationally.  Some examples (not exhaustive) include:


Annexation of Crimea
Alleged use of cyber attacks to disrupt Western powers
Military assertiveness to assist the incumbent regime in Syria
Military assistance to prop up Maduro in Venezuela


So, why hasn't the US been more assertive in confronting and pushing back against this new period of Russian aggression?

It seems to me that, during the Cold War, the US was much more willing to confront the Soviet Union, which at the time was much more powerful than Russia currently is. It was also a nuclear-armed state, so the argument that the US is afraid of Russia's nukes doesn't seem to explain it.

39,"Why has the US not been more assertive in confronting Russia in recent years? Over the past few years, Russia seems to have been slipping back towards an authoritarian system of government, with Putin seemingly cementing his control of the country more and more. Along with this, Russia appears to have become increasingly hostile towards the West and emboldened/aggressive internationally.  Some examples (not exhaustive) include:


Annexation of Crimea
Alleged use of cyber attacks to disrupt Western powers
Military assertiveness to assist the incumbent regime in Syria
Military assistance to prop up Maduro in Venezuela

52,"Is it possible to privatize marriage while keeping incestuous relationships illegal? The concept of marriage privatization, where the state has no authority to define personal relationships, has been growing popular over the last few years in the USA.

However, there have been some concerns expressed by certain groups, particularly by religious conservatives over this concept as it would result possibly in the legalization of polygamous and incestuous relationships.

54,"Why is the lack of seasonal agricultural workers considered a problem given the high unemployment rate in every Western country? Currently farmers in Western countries are warning governments that without foreign workers their fields will be impossible to harvest:


  “We are in need of a lot of foreign workers,” Eystein Ruud, a greenhouse farm owner and chairman of the Norwegian Horticultural Association, told The Globe and Mail. “If we cannot get these workers in the coming weeks, our farmers won’t risk putting a lot of plants in the soil. That may affect the food supply.”


At the same time Western nations are about to face unprecedented levels of unemployment due to the COVID-related shutdowns. On the face of it, this seems like a perfect match - people who lost their jobs could now work their local fields, earning a salary and supplying much needed food for the nation.
