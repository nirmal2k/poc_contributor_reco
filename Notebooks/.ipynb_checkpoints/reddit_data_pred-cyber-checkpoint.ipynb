      "Here’s some tips below I’ve outlined that may help you land an interview or even get the job. I’m doing this because I’ve seen a lot posts lately asking for help and asking what the job market is like right now as I’m looking for my next role and I wanted to consolidate everything I've learned in the past 6 months. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip #1:** Tailor your résumé for the security or networking job that you want. I know this is a lot of work if you’re applying for 3–5 jobs a night but it can make all the difference to the recruiter and the software they push the résumés through. Utilize some of the keywords that they have in the job description so that you get looked at. I like to search google images for tech résumé examples as I'm building mine to borrow from ideas. \n",
      "\n",
      "*Example:* If you have experience in ISO 27001 at your last job and it’s listed in their job description add that in to your professional skills section. \n",
      "\n",
      "*Bonus tip:* Re-write you experience section so it's worded more towards the IT world. An example would be: \"assisted customers with their mobile phone plans and phone issues\" but instead I would say \"Consulted and trained clients in troubleshooting mobile phone issues on new and existing wireless hardware and software\" (you're using more technical words).\n",
      "\n",
      "*Bonus tip 2:* You can add \"key responsibilities\" and also \"key achievements\" under you experience with a job, this will help you stand out, [here's an example of that!](https://imgur.com/a/81OOhhw)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip #2:** If you see a job listed on Indeed or LinkedIn, do not apply on those job boards, go directly to that companies website and try to apply for it there.

      "* **Intro to Tabletop Exercises w/ Amanda Berlin & Jeremy Mio (1-Hour)** \\- Wed, Aug 12, 2020 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM EDT - When testing responses, defenses, and detections of an environment one of the main tools that can be used is a tabletop exercise. A tabletop exercise is a meeting of key stakeholders and staff who walk step by step through the mitigation of some type of disaster, malfunction, attack, or other emergency in a low stress situation. In this short training webinar, we will walk through two basic exercises from beginning to end, covering what helpful structure, items, and activities should be included. We will then follow up each exercise with an after action report to recap. Participants will receive four total tabletops to take and use after the webinar as well as the template for the after action report.

Maybe you’ve only heard the words, but they sound too advanced to learn. Maybe you performed one or two buffer overflows while pursuing a certification, but you still don’t quite understand the underlying mechanics of compiled software exploitation. In this 2-hour workshop-style webcast, we’re going to dive into key concepts of computer organization to learn how x86\\_64 Linux software journeys from C source code to become a functional program in computer memory – ready to be exploited.
